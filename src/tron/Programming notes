5 Oct: Working on analyzing 5x5 matrix and deciding how to move.
I have a Path class define that allows storing prospective paths for future comparison.
It is difficult to decide what to store for turns or direction.  L, F, R / -1, 0, 1 / direction...

9 Oct: I have done the logic for Left, Forward, Right based on abstract moves.
Next is to evaluate the 'complete' Paths and see if a good one starts with a left
(a score for the Paths will come later)
A while loop while Path.complete = true, ....
I am having trouble sending the tactical two-dimensional array back ...
